# Fraud-Detection
Fraudulent transactions pose a significant threat to financial institutions and e-commerce giants like Microsoft. To combat this threat, I have developed a state-of-the-art machine learning model that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to identify and prevent fraudulent activities swiftly and accurately.

# Getting Started
If you're interested in deploying this fraud detection model in your organization, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt'.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to understand the model's architecture and usage.
4. Train the model on your own dataset or fine-tune it to meet your specific requirements.
5. Deploy the model in your production environment and integrate it with your transaction processing system.
